============

Wendy_ is a small website, intended to run on small_ and local instances, for enabling the germination of `web of trust`_.

*Wendy* consists of a big front-end and a small back-end.

The front-end features are:

- generate a key-pair_
- create social profile
- emit a signed digital identity
- certify signed digital identities from peers
- gather and organized the self-certified digital identities from peers
- share the certified digital identities
- analyze the *web of trust*


The back-end eases the data exchange between the peers.
